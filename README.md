# ![icon] Ammobox+
Expanding ammo variety for Terraria [tModLoader]

Ammobox+ is a mod that's entirely dedicated to the ranger specialization of Terraria, and adds 20 new ammo types with new effects and their own recipes to the game.

Currently implemented ammo types:

- Rubber Bullet - has a very high knockback
- Peculiar Bullet - has a chance to turn enemies into a Bunny. Does **not** count as a kill
- Drugged Bullet - creates an aura of damage around a shot enemy. Other drugged enemies are not affected by the aura.
- Ice Bullet - slows down enemies, with a chance to freeze them. The chance is doubled in water.
- Markershot - shot enemy takes 15% more damage
- Miner Bullet - has a low chance of dropping a random amount of ore
- Spectral Bullet - can penetrate up to 4 blocks, but the accuracy decreases substantially with each block
- Starfall Bullet - has a low chance to turn into a star

- And more! Dart update adds 12 new dart types to the game!

## Known Issues
- Miner Bullets do not drop modded ores, this is planned to be implemented in the near future
- Ice/Slime ammo may rarely cause erratic movement in enemies, please report such cases on the Issue Tracker on GitHub
- Debuffs do not apply to players in PvP

## Changelog
- v1.1.2.4 - **Dart Update!** 12 new ammo types (Darts), ranging from Pre-Hardmode to Hardmode. 
	           Netsync should be more stable now
             Redid slime and ice effects, should work without any bugs on most enemies (a blacklist for certain enemies still exists)

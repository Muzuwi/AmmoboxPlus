# ![icon] Ammobox+
Expanding ammo variety for Terraria [tModLoader]

Ammobox+ is a mod that's (currently) entirely dedicated to the Gunner specialization of Terraria, and adds 8 new ammo types with new effects and their own recipes to the game.

Currently implemented ammo types:

- Rubber Bullet - has a very high knockback
- Peculiar Bullet - has a chance to turn enemies into a Bunny
- Drugged Bullet - creates an aura of damage around a shot enemy
- Ice Bullet - slows down enemies, with a chance to freeze them
- Markershot - shot enemy takes 15% more damage
- Miner Bullet - has a low chance of dropping a random amount of ore
- Spectral Bullet - can penetrate up to 4 blocks, but the accuracy decreases substantially with each block
- Starfall Bullet - has a low chance to turn into a star

## Known Issues
- Miner Bullets will not drop modded ores, this is planned to be fixed in the near future
- Ice Bullets can sometimes cause weird movement in enemies, such as falling through the ground (for flying enemies). Please report such cases on the issue tracker or in the thread.
- Debuffs do not apply to players in PvP

## Planned Features
- Better cross-mod compatibility

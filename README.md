# ![icon] Ammobox+
Expanding ammo variety for Terraria [tModLoader]

Ammobox+ is a mod that's entirely dedicated to the ranger specialization of Terraria, and adds 30 new ammo types with new effects and their own recipes to the game.

Currently implemented ammo types:

- Rubber Bullet - has a very high knockback
- Peculiar Bullet - has a chance to turn enemies into a Bunny. Does **not** count as a kill
- Drugged Bullet - creates an aura of damage around a shot enemy. Other drugged enemies are not affected by the aura.
- Ice Bullet - slows down enemies, with a chance to freeze them. The chance is doubled in water.
- Markershot - shot enemy takes 15% more damage
- Miner Bullet - has a low chance of dropping a random amount of ore
- Spectral Bullet - can penetrate up to 4 blocks, but the accuracy decreases substantially with each block
- Starfall Bullet - has a low chance to turn into a star

- And more! Arrow and Dart updates add 22 new ammo types to the game!

## Known Issues

Ammobox+ is a mod that's entirely dedicated to the Gunner specialization of Terraria, and adds 8 new ammo types with new effects and their own recipes to the game.
Currently added ammo types:
    - Rubber Bullet - has a very high knockback
    - Peculiar Bullet - has a chance to turn enemies into a Bunny
    - Drugged Bullet - creates an aura of damage around a shot enemy
    - Ice Bullet - slows down enemies, with a chance to freeze them
    - Markershot - shot enemy takes 15% more damage
    - Miner Bullet - has a low chance of dropping a random amount of ore
    - Spectral Bullet - can penetrate up to 4 blocks, but the accuracy decreases substantially with each block
    - Starfall Bullet - has a low chance to turn into a star
